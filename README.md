# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [How to Code Natural Language Processing on Android With IBM Watson][published url]
## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]


Thanks to the rising wave of artificial intelligence, users these days have come to expect apps that are both smart and aware of the contexts in which they're being used. IBM Watson offers a variety of natural language-related services you can use to create such apps.

For instance, you can use its Natural Language Understanding service to extract keywords, entities, sentiments, and a lot of other semantic details from any text the user is reading. And if the text happens to be in a foreign language, you can use the Language Translator service to identify the language and translate it to one the user understands.

In this tutorial, I'm going to introduce you to few of those services by showing you how to create an app that can translate German webpages to English and extract sentiments, important entities, and emotions from them.
